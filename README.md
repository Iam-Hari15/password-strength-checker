#Password Strength Checker
This project provides a web application that evaluates the strength of a password entered by the user. It uses a backend built with Node.js and Express to check the password's strength based on predefined criteria. The frontend is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interface that communicates with the backend to provide real-time feedback on password strength.

#Features:
Password Strength Checking: The backend checks the password strength and returns "Weak", "Moderate", or "Strong" based on the following criteria:

#Weak: Less than 8 characters.
#Moderate: More than 8 characters, containing alphabetic characters.
#Strong: More than 12 characters, containing uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Frontend Interface: The frontend allows users to enter a password and receive immediate feedback on its strength.

Real-time Feedback: The password strength is checked and displayed dynamically when the user clicks the "Check Strength" button.
